## Overview

This repository is the canonical source of reusable Labki wiki content packs. Each pack encapsulates a set of pages (templates, forms, properties, categories) designed to work together and be safely imported into any Labki instance.

### Scope
- Templates and PageForms for structured data entry
- Semantic properties and categories for data modeling
- Layouts and example pages to standardize operations

Out of scope: unstructured narrative documentation; this repo focuses on reusable wiki content.
